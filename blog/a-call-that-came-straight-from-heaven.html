                    It was the time of winter and winter means laziness. We all know that it is tremendously difficult to wake up early in the morning. Seriously you need a strong will to do that. After struggling all week in university, finally, it comes, our desired Friday. This the day we all have been looking for the whole week. The definition of the holiday varies from person to person. But most of the person spends their time by giving themselves some space. And that’s how it should be right? Well, I’m one of them. And I choose to do whatever comes in my mind whether it might be playing video games or writing codes, exam preparation or solving a problem. Just do it in my own way.
                  </p>

                  <br>

                  <p>
                    As a Muslim, Friday is an important day for us. We all know why. Its Jummah Day. If a believer skips 3 Jummahs in a row, then a sealed is placed on his heart. Means if you want to acknowledge yourself as a Muslim or stay in the shade of Islam, you must have to pray Jummah Salaah in every week. In my childhood, I called Friday as “Jummah Day” because my family taught me that. I was a little kid back then where I went to the Mosque with my friends to pray the Salah. Jummah day was the festive day for us to enjoy and roaming around. The most interesting part for us that before the start of Fardh Salah, the Imam requested some people to volunteer themselves and help to raise money for the Mosque from every row. My friends and I had to wait for this in every Jummah prayer and grab the opportunity to volunteer. Generally, the process began by standing up from every row, take our own cap in hands and gather money on it. This process was popular back then. It was a foremost responsibility for us. As a kid, I was very religious. I tried to pray salah in Mosque and known to everyone as a good kid. I never missed a Jummah prayer back then and tried to reach the Mosque as early as the Adhan announced.
                  </p>

                  <br>

                  <p>
                    But my adolescent age messed things up totally. I started to miss Salaah after I have grown up and ignored my good deeds for the sake of worldly activities. Hence, I missed two Jummah consecutively. Next week hypothetically speaking, it was a cold day and I needed to pray Jummah prayer for must. No off is acceptable this time because I already missed the last two of them. So, I woke up early and started to check my social media. Slowly took breakfast and laid down on my bed. Then Shaytaan came to me (not literally) and helped me to relax like hell. Thus, I felt sleepy and I went to the first stage of sleepiness. On the other hand, my mother and sister shouting at me to go to the Mosque and I just ignore them as the most possible way as I can with the help of Shaytaan dude. I determined and convinced myself to miss the prayer this time again and chose to sleep instead. It was 12:50 pm at the clock and the prayer would be started at sharp 1:10 o’clock. Then the dramatical incident happened to me.  Suddenly my mobile rang at its full sound and my sleepiness state broke down miraculously. I receive the phone and say, “Hello?” “Hello Sir, we are from the bank. We are so sorry for not picking up your phone last Wednesday. Do you have any query about our services that you really want to know?” - said from the other side of the phone. I remembered instantly that I called them for my account related issue but they didn’t pick up my call which was the incident of two days ago. After two minutes of talk, I cut the phone. I realized all my fatigue, laziness and notorious trick of Shaytaan gone from my body and I felt energetic and enthusiastic both at the same time. I rushed and took a shower quickly, dressed up and ran to the Mosque for attending the prayer. After that, I felt much more energetic and happier. It was a guilt-free day for me.
                  </p>

                  <br>

                  <p>
                    But what exactly happened at that time if we analyze the situation closely? I can say that ‘the call’ single-handedly changed the whole thing. The call I got on Friday which was never supposed to arrive generally. Was it a coincidence? How did a call is enough to change my decision drove entirely in the opposite direction? Is it a medium or the gateway for me to choose the right decision from Allah?
                    Well, theoretically there is some explanation in science. It may be simple and logical to you to accept this incident differently such as phone disturbed and troubled my sleep so that my sleepiness totally cut off from the edge. That’s what it really happened but the spooky part was the timing of the call, drove my decision to an inverse direction.
                  </p>

                  <br>

                  <p>Allah says,</p>

                  <blockquote cite="http://">
                    <em>“Then as for him who gives away and guards (against evil). <br>
                      And accepts the best. We will facilitate for him the easy end. <br>
                      And as for him who is niggardly and considers himself free from need (of Allah). <br>
                      And rejects the best. We will facilitate for him the difficult end”. <br>
                    </em>
                    - <strong>[Qur’an 92: 5 to 10]</strong>
                  </blockquote>

                  <br>

                  <p>
                    The essence: Allah guides whom He wills and lets astray whom He wills.
                    We often receive blessings from Almighty God that we may not even realize.
